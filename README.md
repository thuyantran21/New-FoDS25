#Introduction and Motivation
Healthcare disparities across different demographic groups are well-documented, yet they remain persistent and deeply rooted in socioeconomic and structural inequalities. According to research, certain racial and ethnic populations, alongside gender differences, face heightened risks for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and increased mortality rates. This project aims to analyze these disparities through data-driven approaches, leveraging county-level health data and extreme gradient boosting model, binary classification or with multi-class classification to highlight patterns and critical risk factors that contribute to these differences.
The primary motivation for this project stems from observed gaps in health outcomes, as highlighted in the literature. For instance, Black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations consistently experience elevated rates of obesity-related mortality and higher incidence of chronic diseases (Quelle). Additionally, socioeconomic factors such as income and education levels further exacerbate these risks, with substantial geographic disparities across the United States (Quelle). Understanding these factors through predictive modeling can aid in targeted public health interventions and policy-making. 

#Research Hypothesis:
Health outcomes such as diabetes prevalence, obesity rates, and mortality figures show significant disparities across different racial and gender groups, influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors. Our analysis aims to identify these disparities and explore predictive modeling to highlight key determinants.

Motivation in kurz:
1. Understanding and highlight gaps
2. public health interventions
3. New policy-making
4. Focus on certain affected groups -> early prevention
5. With and after cross validation, the script/ code calculates and identifies the top 3 most important feature contributing to the prediction
6. Roc curve

Ãœbung:
1. sollen zeigen, dass wir mehrere 1-2 Modelle ausprobiert haben
2. Cross validation in unserem projekt
3. Model training XG boost and random forest classification
4. Analysis of which model explains and answers our hypothesis the best
